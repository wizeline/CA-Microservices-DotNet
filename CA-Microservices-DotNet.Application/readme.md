## Application Layer

This layer implements the core business logic of the application following Clean Architecture principles. It interacts with the Presentation Layer (e.g., Web API controllers) and the Domain Layer.

**Key Components:**

* **Services Folder:** Contains application service implementations representing use cases. These services orchestrate domain logic and interact with the Domain Layer.
* **Mappings Folder:** Contains AutoMapper profiles that define how data gets mapped between Domain Layer models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used by the Presentation Layer.

**Benefits:**

* Improved testability and maintainability of business logic.
* Reusability of services across different presentation layers.

**Structure:**

* Organize services by feature or domain area within the Services folder.
* Keep corresponding AutoMapper profiles for each entity in the Mappings folder.
