## Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer implements technical details for persistence and data access according to the specifications defined in the Domain Layer. It adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, separating concerns and promoting loose coupling.

**Key Components:**

* **EntityConfigurations Folder (Likely):** Contains Entity Framework Core configurations using Fluent API. These configurations map domain entities (from the Domain Layer) to corresponding database tables and define relationships.
* **Migrations Folder:** Stores database migration scripts generated by Entity Framework Core. These scripts manage schema changes to your database over time. 
* **Repositories Folder:** Contains concrete implementations of repository interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. These implementations typically use Entity Framework Core or other persistence technologies to perform data access operations.

**Responsibilities:**

* Implements concrete data access logic using Entity Framework Core or other persistence technologies.
* Defines mappings between domain entities and database tables using Entity Framework Core Fluent API (or similar mechanisms for other ORMs).
* Provides implementations of repository interfaces defined in the Domain Layer, translating those interfaces into concrete database operations.

**Benefits:**

* Improved isolation of persistence details from the core business logic.
* Easier switching between different persistence mechanisms if needed.
* Promotes better testability of infrastructure components.

**Structure:**

* Organize Entity Framework Core configurations by domain entity within the `EntityConfigurations` folder (or a similarly named folder based on your ORM).
* Store database migration scripts chronologically within the `Migrations` folder.
* Group repository implementations by the type of data they access within the `Repositories` folder.

This revised version incorporates the `Migrations` folder and clarifies the purpose of the `Repositories` folder. Remember, the specific folder names and structure might vary slightly depending on your chosen persistence technologies.
