## Domain Layer

The Domain Layer represents the core business concepts of the application, independent of any infrastructure or presentation concerns. It adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture.

**Key Components:**

* **Entities Folder:** Contains classes representing domain objects (entities) with their properties and behavior. These entities model real-world concepts relevant to your application domain.
* **Interfaces Folder:**
    * **Repositories Folder:** Defines interfaces for data access logic. Repositories provide methods to retrieve, add, update, and delete domain objects without specifying a concrete persistence mechanism.
    * **Services Folder:** Handles specific services beyond basic CRUD operations, you can define interfaces for those services here. These services should strictly depend on domain object interfaces and not on any infrastructure concerns. 

**Responsibilities:**

* Defines core domain concepts through entities.
* Encapsulates domain logic and business rules within entities or domain services.
* Provides data access abstractions through repository interfaces.

**Benefits:**

* Improved testability and maintainability of domain logic.
* Promotes loose coupling between the Domain Layer and other layers.
* Easier integration with different persistence mechanisms.

**Structure:**

* Organize entities by feature or domain area within the Entities folder.
* Group repository interfaces by the type of data they access within the Repositories folder.
* Define domain service interfaces within a separate folder under Interfaces.
